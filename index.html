  <!-- About Me Section -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2 class="section-heading">About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
        <p>I am a data analyst with over a year of experience in startups (SaaS) and as an Associate Solution Engineer at Brane Enterprises. My expertise lies in data analysis using tools such as SQL, Python, database management, Pandas, and Zoho Analytics Business Intelligence. I specialize in transforming data into insights and actionable solutions.</p>

        <p>In my previous role, I extensively used SQL daily to create reports and dashboards. I also utilized Zoho Analytics, Ruby on Rails to embed reports, tested dashboard APIs with Postman, and worked with Grafana for time series data.</p>

        <p>I graduated from the Institute of Eminence (IoE) tagged IIT Kharagpur in 2021 with a dual degree (BTech and MTech) in Biotechnology. Outside of work, I enjoy playing outdoor sports and reading newspapers, which I believe contribute to my growth as a professional and a well-rounded individual. I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies to enhance my data analysis capabilities.</p>

        <p>I am seeking opportunities to join a dynamic and innovative team where I can contribute to solving real-world problems with data.</p>
